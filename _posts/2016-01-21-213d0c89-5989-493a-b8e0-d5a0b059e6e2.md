Who am I? 

I ask, and you didn't 

Creases from squinting
into   
the light of your eyes 

fatigue envelopes all of me 

I've wasted many millions of minutes   
holding
the torch to light your steps 

you've wasted my youth while
you   
continue to grow ever more... 

I won't say... 

Don't look back always was your
theme 

and you didn't...
