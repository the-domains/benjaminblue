Those times I felt infinite... 

When we were spread out like
beach towels 

I counted those blessings
as religiously but not,   
as much
as I could 

our hands always found each other
with closed eyes 

you always knew who I was
and how to disable my defenses 

you knew me...and what made
me lay down my heart on the table 

I gave you the keys to every lock 

worried you'd kill the nerves
but you never did... 

it was I 

With every flurry of worry
catching on my brow like
endless winter 

the cold leaked in and
froze those moments into
what I used to know...
