            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>You can get David Bowie's only video game for free until Jan. 22</h1><p>David Bowie was perfectly cast in dual roles as an all-digital techno-revolutionary and a space-age rock star in Quantic Dream's 1999 game, Omikron: The Nomad Soul. Now, publisher Square Enix is celebrating the late, great musician's life and work by handing out free copies of the game.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/bbc1e90056eb296e31f0b5a49f36a90473a20427.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Progress...]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Progress...</h1><p>It's day 6 or 7 of using the 30 day shred workout.  My endurance is increasing ever so slightly.  I'm still a little bit off from being about to complete the full workout in the timeframe.  It's tough!  I find myself winded, but taking less breaks than I had the time before.  So it's working.  My goal is to get to or close to a certain weight that I haven't seen since my late teens,early 20's.  Once upon a time, I weighed about 180 lbs.  Right now, I'm about 230 lbs, but I've also been lifting weights.  Back then, I wasn't.  I don't think I could ever get that low in weight again, but I want to get as close as I can. My priorities have changed. I used to be obsessed with the whole beardom and fitting into that niche.  As I got older, I stopped caring.  I don't really want to fit into that anymore.  I'm happy just doing my own thing here.  I don't use any of those terms to describe who I am aside from bearded and hairy.  IDK.  My views of myself have changed.  I suppose I can say that I did use the bear community as a stepping stone for acceptance for my body type in my late teens and early 20's.  Since then, things have evolved.  This is my last year of my 20's and I didn't want to enter my 30's looking the way I do.  I've always been heavier and with a belly.  There was never a time where I didn't have a belly.  Even when I was at my lowest weight, it was still there.  I can say now, though I'm far off where I want to be, I am the most fit I've ever been in my life, and I hope to continue this upward trend.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Idk</h1><p>I need additional income.  I'm considering uber driving to make up some extra cash.  I have too much debt.  Though I make barely enough to pay all my bills, I don't make enough to save, or do much else.  I work from home currently, so my car is mostly sitting unused.  Even an extra $100 here and there would make a huge difference.  We shall see.</p></article>]]></description>
